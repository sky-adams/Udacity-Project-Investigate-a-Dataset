# Udacity-Project-Investigate-a-Dataset

## Description
I completed this project as part of Udacity's Data Analyst nanodegree program. This project shows my ability to use pandas to go through the data analysis process. The analysis uses data from Kaggle ([original source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments)) on medical appointments in Brazil, and it uncovers interesting correlations in the data.
